# Rebalance

Mozilla / Degiro extension to rebalance your financial portfolio.

## Getting Started

This extension was designed as a simple tool to help an investor rebalance his portfolio. You can specify a reinforcement value 
and the desired proportions for each of your assets and the script will tell you what to buy and sell to get as close 
as possible to your objectives. Please note that this add-on is still under development and has not yet been signed and published 
to the AMO distribution platform. Despite not being publicly available yet, you can still download it and use it, following 
the steps described below.
